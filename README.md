Author: Parameswar rao

Date: 4 April 2020

I implimented model by using Skyserver_SQL2_27_2018 6_51_39 PM.csv to classify astronomical objects(Galaxies, Stars and Quasars) by using Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16 Server Data features. This project is organized as follows:

(a) extract features from data set.
(b) data preprocessing and split into train and test data for a given model.
(c) basic random forest classfication algorithm implimentation.
(d) Analysis of summary and results of model.

Skyserver_SQL2_27_2018 6_51_39 PM.csv: data set for given model.

Result:
1. Accuracy: 0.9842424242424243
